ORBIT (Orbital Runtime Badly Interpreted Thingy)
---

**DEVELOPMENT WARNING**
Like any "in development" project, this might go on an unannounced indefinite hiatus at any moment.
Please read everything below with a grain of salt, as most of these features haven't been implemented.

ORBIT is a procedural programming language, aimed towards replacing [`kerboscript`](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS).
However, ORBIT is also interpretable without the kOS mod. This makes it easier to develop and more adaptable to new developments, such as replacing `ksm` with something else.

## Why ORBIT?
ORBIT uses a friendlier C-Style syntax, immutability by default, strict typing, and a few functional features. Unlike `kerboscript`, it features modules, bitwise operations, algebraic data types and library support.
